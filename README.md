# barycentric-hermite-treecode

This repo contains source code for the barycentric Hermite treecode (BHTC), barycentric Lagrange treecode (BLTC), and Taylor treecode (TTC) for computing Coulomb and screened Coulomb interactions. A Makefile is provided as well as two data files for a test case with N=1e5 particles (charges_1e5.txt, particles_1e5.txt).
